  - Good Evening!
  - 'We begin tonight with a major developing story: a sudden and widespread power
    outage left much of the city in darkness late last night.'
  - The blackout began shortly after 10 PM, affecting traffic systems, hospitals,
    and thousands of homes. More than 14,000 residents were without electricity for
    hours.
  - Officials believe the outage was caused by a blown transformer in the downtown
    core, possibly due to surging demand from extreme heat.
  - "The city\u2019s backup generators kicked in for critical infrastructure, but
    many neighborhoods remained without power until early morning."
  - "One bright spot emerged from the night, quite literally \u2014 a local caf\xE9
    owner, Tara Nguyen, stayed open using battery-powered lanterns and a camping
    stove."
  - "She served free drinks and allowed people to charge phones and devices, turning
    her caf\xE9 into a community hub during the blackout."
  - "Social media quickly praised her actions, with neighbors calling her \u201Ca
    light in the dark."
  - "City officials say they plan to formally recognize Nguyen at next week\u2019s
    council meeting."
  - As of this evening, power has been fully restored across the grid, and investigations
    into the root cause are still underway.
  - "We\u2019ll continue to bring you updates as more information becomes available."
  - For now, stay safe, stay cool, and thank you for joining us tonight.
